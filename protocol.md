# Protocol

A simplified overview of the process:
- [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
- Add your code.
- Submit a [_pull request_](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to the project owner.

## Step 1: Forking a repository

By creating a "fork," you are producing a personal copy of someone else's project [^1]; in this case, a repository owned by Strategic Machines.

To fork a repository and get a working copy of it on your computer:
1. On GitHub, navigate to the repository you wish to fork.
1. In the top-right corner of the page, click __Fork__ [^2].

That's it. You just forked the repository.

## Step 2: Create a local clone of your fork

Now that you've forked the repository to which you'll be contributing, you need to get a copy of it on your computer. To achieve this: 

1. Navigate to __your fork__ of the repository on GitHub
1. Under the repository name, click __Clone or Download__.
1. Copy the given URL.
1. Open the Terminal in your computer.
1. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository
1. Type `git clone` and then paste the URL copied in bullet point 3. It should look like this, with your GitHub username and the repository's name instead of `YOUR-USERNAME` and `REPOSITORY-NAME`: 
    - ```$ git clone https:://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME  ```
1. Press __Enter__. This will start the cloning process.

That's it! Now you have a local copy of your fork.

## Step 3: Configuring Git to sync your fork with the original repository.

## Step 4: Create a branch
